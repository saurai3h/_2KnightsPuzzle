# _2KnightsPuzzle

A white and black knight start from opposite corners of a chessboard, making random legal moves. The white knight moves first, then the black knight, and so on in turn. As in chess, either knight may capture the other if it moves to the square the other occupies.

What is the probability that both knights survive for 64 move—32 moves of the white knight and 32 moves of the black knight—rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point?
